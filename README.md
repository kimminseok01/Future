# Future

Hi,

I am minseok in group 13.

This is the project in machine learning and application course in Yonsei University.

We made diagnosing cancer model using simple machine learning algorighms.

We used svm. random forest, and gradientboosting which are widely used for their simplicity and accuracy.

Raw data in csv file is composed of 116 patients who suffered cancer.

It contains labels that indicate whether the patient has cancer or not(1 means negative, 2 means positive) and more than 800 features(F).

Check which algorithm is the best tool for disgnosis!
