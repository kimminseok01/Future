# Future
project

This is the project of diagnosing cancer using machine learning algorighms.

I used svm. random forest, and gradientboosting which are widely used for their simplicity and accuracy.

Raw data is composed of 116 patients who suffered cancer.

It contains whether the patient has cancer(1 means negative, 2 means positive) and various features(F)

Check which algorithm is the best tool for disgnosis!
